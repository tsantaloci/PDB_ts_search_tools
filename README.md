# PDB_ts_search_tools
A handful of scripts that I am working on to help organize reaction dynamic data from PDB files for enzymes.
So far these are just helper scripts. The pdb_file_checker.py determines if a pdb file is the same by calculating the percentage change of that Cartesian coordinates.
The script assumes the pdb files are the same protein.
